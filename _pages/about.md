I am a third year PhD student in the [Division of Applied Mathematics](https://appliedmath.brown.edu/) at [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/) working with [Johnny Guzm√°n](https://appliedmath.brown.edu/people/johnny-guzman). I work on numerical methods for partial differential equations. So far, I have mainly worked on the analysis of [finite element methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_element_method), and in particular, the [finite element exterior calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_element_exterior_calculus) (FEEC).

I obtained my B.Sc. in Mathematics from the [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/) in 2022.
