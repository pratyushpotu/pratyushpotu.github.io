I am a fourth year PhD student in the [Division of Applied Mathematics](https://appliedmath.brown.edu/) at Brown University working with [Johnny Guzm√°n](https://appliedmath.brown.edu/people/johnny-guzman). I work on numerical methods for partial differential equations. I have mainly worked on the analysis of finite element exterior calculus (FEEC) and discrete exterior calculus (DEC).

Previously, I obtained my B.Sc. in Mathematics from the University of Texas at Austin in 2022.
